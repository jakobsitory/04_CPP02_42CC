# **C++ Module 02**

This repository contains solutions to various C++ programming challenges from the 42 Berlin curriculum. Each module is designed to deepen students' understanding of different programming concepts and techniques.

## **Exercises**

### **ex00 - My First Class in Orthodox Canonical Form**
A class that adheres to the Orthodox Canonical Form in C++.

**Key objectives included:**

- Implementing a class with a default constructor, copy constructor, copy assignment operator, and destructor.
- Demonstrating an understanding of the Orthodox Canonical Form.
- Ensuring proper resource management and object copying.

### **ex01 - Towards a more useful fixed-point number class**
A more useful fixed-point number class project involves creating a fixed-point number class with arithmetic operations.

**Key objectives included:**

- Implementing a fixed-point number class.
- Overloading arithmetic operators for the class.
- Demonstrating an understanding of operator overloading and fixed-point arithmetic.

### **ex02 - Now weâ€™re talking**
Extending the fixed-point number class to include comparison operators and other useful methods.

**Key objectives included:**

- Extending the fixed-point number class with comparison operators.
- Adding additional methods for the class.
- Demonstrating an understanding of operator overloading and class design.

### **ex03 - BSP**
A function to determine if a point is inside a triangle using binary space partitioning.

**Key objectives included:**

- Implementing a function to check if a point is inside a triangle.
- Using binary space partitioning techniques.
- Demonstrating an understanding of geometric algorithms and binary space partitioning.
